This project showcases the ability to effectively preprocess image data and build deep learning models for image-related tasks.  It covers key preprocessing steps, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation and explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.  Furthermore, the project leverages transfer learning by fine-tuning the VGG16 network, making use of its pre-trained knowledge to improve performance and reduce training time.
